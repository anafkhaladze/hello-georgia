            <h3>About Alaverdi</h3>
            <h5>Best time to visit : ALL SEASON</h5>
            <p>Alaverdi - Cathedral and Monastery is located in the Kakheti region of Akhmeta municipality, on Alazani valley, near the village of Alaverdi, 20 km from Telavi.
            <br>
            <br>
            The temple is one of the largest church buildings in Georgia. 
            Its height including dome is above 50 meters.
            <br>
            <br>
            The complex includes buildings: Alaverdi St. George Cathedral, defensive wall, chapel, Peikar-Khan's palace, wine cellar and bath.
            <br>
            <br>
            Alaverdi Monastery was founded by Joseph Alaverdeli, one of the Assyrian fathers in the middle of the VI century.
            <br>
            <br>
            At the beginning of the XI century, Kvirike the King of Kakheti built a cathedral (which is known by the name of Alaverdi) at the site of the little church of St. George.
            <br>
            <br>
            Alaverdi was one of the most outstanding chapels of medieval Georgia. Alaverdoba (September-October) was very popular ecclesiastical and public holiday. 
            Which was celebrated not only by Georgians (from Kakheti, Kiziki, Ertso-Tianeti, Pshav-Khevsureti) but Kists And Dagestan people as well. The market was also held.</p>


            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Alaverdi Monastery, founded in the 6th century by Joseph Alaverdeli, is located in the Alazani Valley, 20 km from Telavi. 
            In the 11th century, King Kvirike of Kakheti built the grand St. George Cathedral, standing over 50 meters high.
            <br>
            <br>
            A religious and royal burial site, Alaverdi suffered earthquake damage and was restored in the 15th and 18th centuries. 
            The monastery complex, enclosed by a defensive wall, includes a palace, bell tower, bathhouse, and wine cellar. 
            It was also a center for Georgian literary activity, home to scholars like Philippe Alaverdeli and Niceforo Irbachi.</p>

            <h3>Legend</h3>
            <p>The holy monk Ioseb Alaverdeli lived in the Alaverdi floodplain in Kakheti. 
            Nearby, Naghara-Khan had a palace on a mountain ridge. One day, while hunting, his falcon chased a pheasant that sought refuge with the monk. 
            When Khan attempted to kill the monk, his arm suddenly froze. 
            Realizing the miracle, he begged for healing, promising to grant the monk’s wish. Upon being cured through prayer, Khan fulfilled the monk’s request and built St. George’s Church in Alaverdi.
            <br>
            <br>
            Later, a boy who often lost in wrestling prayed to St. George for strength, offering a fried egg at the church. 
            Greek traders passing by ate the egg and soon fell ill. 
            Seeking help, they learned their sickness was due to St. George’s anger. 
            They vowed to build a temple if cured, and upon healing, fulfilled their promise by constructing the grand Alaverdi Cathedral. 
            This story inspired the Georgian proverb: “No one can take St. George’s scrambled eggs.”</p>
