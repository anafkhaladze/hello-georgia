                <h3>About Petra Fortress</h3>
                <h5>Best time to visit : ALL SEASON</h5>
                <p>Petra Fortress, located in Tsikhisdziri, Adjara, was built by John Strathegos in 535. Known as "Petra" in Byzantine and "Castle of Kajeti" in Georgian, 
                it is believed to be referenced in Rustaveli's The Knight in the Pantherâ€™s Skin. The fortress is 9 km from Kobuleti, 
                situated 440 meters above sea level on the Black Sea coast.</p>

                <!-- Description -->
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>Petra Fortress, located on a rocky hillside by the sea, was considered an inaccessible stronghold. The archaeological site includes the Citadel, surrounding settlements, 
                and remnants of a palace, baths, farmhouses, soldiers' residences, and a 6th-7th century basilica, believed to be the Episcopal Cathedral of Peter. Excavations, starting in the 1930s, 
                have revealed significant finds, including a rich tomb in 1908. Petra was a key episcopal center of the Diocese of Lazika, with its cathedral existing until the 9th century, 
                after which the center moved to Khinotsminda.</p>

                <!-- history -->
                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Before the large fortress-town was built, a small stronghold of the Lazi people existed, though no traces remain today. The fortress was constructed in 535 by Byzantine Emperor Ioane Strathegos, 
                called "The City of Justinian." Petra-Kajeti was crucial in the political and economic life of western Georgia, controlling sea routes and connecting with Byzantine provinces, Iran, and Armenia. 
                It played a key role in the 6th-century Great War of Egris. The bishopric was abolished in the 10th century, but Petra remained important, even in the 15th century, when it was still known as "Kaltikhea." 
                The Ottomans fortified Tsikhisdziri in the 18th century, and despite multiple wars, the fortress resisted conquest until it was returned to Georgia in 1878. 
                Part of it was destroyed during the construction of the Baku-Batumi railway in the 19th century.</p>
