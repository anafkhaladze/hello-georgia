                <h3>About Khikhani Fortress</h3>
                <h5>Best time to visit : Summer, May, September, October</h5>
                <p>Khikhani Fortress, located in Tkhilvana, Khulo municipality, is a medieval stronghold with walls, towers, and a church. Built in a strategic location, it served as a shelter for Georgian nobles. 
                The St. George Church was constructed in the 13th century by Archduke Tbel. The fortress is linked to Queen Tamar and is sometimes called Tamar Castle. 
                It has been under restoration since 2012.</p>

                <!-- architecture -->
                <h3>Architecture</h3>
                <p>Khikhani Fortress covers about one hectare, with a steep slope and a pedestrian path leading to the southeast. The fortress has two main construction layers: ancient (X-XI centuries) and Ottoman-era (XVII-XIX centuries).
                <br>
                The ruins include four towers and a "wine house" (Marani) with five Kvevri. The walls, built of brick, are 5-6 meters high and 90-95 cm thick, though some are damaged. St. George’s Church, small and hall-type, still has its foundation. 
                Other remains include a well, bakery, and additional buildings.</p>

                <!-- history -->
                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>The exact date of Khikhani Fortress' construction is unknown, but it’s believed to have been built between the X-XIII centuries. The fortress was the main residence of the Abuseridze family from the XI-XVI centuries until the Ottomans took control.
                <br>
                In 1815, Selim Khimshiashvili fought against the Ottomans here. After a failed attempt to negotiate, he was betrayed and executed by an Armenian. Before his death, he proclaimed that Georgia would never fall to the Ottomans. 
                His head was sent to the Sultan in Istanbul, who, angry over Selim’s death, ordered the execution of Mahmoud Pasha. Selim is buried in Nigazeuli, and his head rests in Istanbul.</p>

                <!-- legend -->
                <h3>Legend</h3>
                <p>According to legend, Khikhani Fortress had secret underground tunnels connecting to nearby villages. One tunnel near Bako was believed to connect the fortress to Zarzma Monastery, where King Tamar prayed and secretly fetched water. 
                Another tunnel, in Prasnauli Mountain, allowed her to escape across the Potskho Gorge. When the Shah discovered the tunnel and tried to capture her, King Tamar reportedly poisoned herself to avoid capture, 
                symbolizing her power and resilience in local folklore.</p>
