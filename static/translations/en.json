  "history_text": "Adjara, one of Georgia’s oldest regions, was historically part of Upper Kartli and Meskheti. First mentioned in the 11th century by Leonti Mroveli, its history dates back to the Stone Age, with Bronze and Iron Age artifacts found in the area. Christianity was introduced here by Apostle Andrew. In the 15th-17th centuries, Adjara was ruled by Gurieli and later conquered by the Ottomans, leading to widespread Islamization while preserving Georgian identity. After Ottoman rule ended in 1878, it became part of the Russian Empire, later an autonomous republic under Soviet rule, a status it retains in independent Georgia.",
